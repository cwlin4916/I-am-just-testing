abstract = {Neural manifolds provide a quantitative, geometric language for describing how the activity profiles of individual neurons combine to encode complex information. However, neurons in distinct neural populations may exhibit very different statistics in response to similar stimuli. As a result, the geometry of the corresponding neural manifolds may look quite different. We introduce the method of analogous cycles, which allows for robust and falsifiable inference of matchings between features of neural manifolds that code, at the population level, for related nonlinear topological features. This method is deterministic, does not involve dimensionality reduction or estimation, and requires only observations of intrinsic activity, without reference to external stimuli. We demonstrate its effectiveness on both simulations and in vivo experimental data. Neural manifolds summarize the intrinsic structure of the information encoded by a population of neurons. Advances in experimental techniques have made simultaneous recordings from multiple brain regions increasingly commonplace, raising the possibility of studying how these manifolds relate across populations. However, when the manifolds are nonlinear and possibly code for multiple unknown variables, it is challenging to extract robust and falsifiable information about their relationships. We introduce a framework, called the method of analogous cycles, for matching topological features of neural manifolds using only observed dissimilarity matrices within and between neural populations. We demonstrate via analysis of simulations and in vivo experimental data that this method can be used to correctly identify multiple shared circular coordinate systems across both stimuli and inferred neural manifolds. Conversely, the method rejects matching features that are not intrinsic to one of the systems. Further, as this method is deterministic and does not rely on dimensionality reduction or optimization methods, it is amenable to direct mathematical investigation and interpretation in terms of the underlying neural activity. We thus propose the method of analogous cycles as a suitable foundation for a theory of cross-population analysis via neural manifolds.}}
