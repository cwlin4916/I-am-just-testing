<h4>Brasied pork and all that </h4>
<p>
    滷肉飯. Some from southern Taiwan refer this as 肉燥飯. In most cases, if I were to explain this 
    to a foreigner I would say this is "minced pork stewed in soya sauce." Some from northern Taiwan also refer this 
    as  爌肉飯 or 控肉飯 but this usually refers to (pretty much same method cooked with) larger pieces of pork meat (mostly pork belly). 

<br> 
    <br>
    控肉飯 is more a transliteration of braised pork in Min, a language spoken by people 
    in the Fujian (or Hokkien) province. (Of course, there are various versions of Min, so Taiwanese usually calls their version Taiwanese Hokkien).
    A key ingredient present in the "large piece" version that is usually not is the use of Fish sauce, usually made by covering fish in salt and fermentation.
