   This is a diary for teaching. dmy. I will be the instructor for 110.113. Ngl. I don't know what it means to be <i>honors</i>. 
   <br> 
   <br> 
  <i> 08/29/30: </i> Today is the first day. Wasn't bad nor that good. 
   What went well: I was afraid that i could not motivate the Peano's axiom. But I think it went fine. A line of questions 
   from easy to hard that seems to workout. For example: 
   <ul>
   <li>
    What is the first thing that comes up in your mind when I say "counting number": 
   </li>
  <p> Most common was 1.  Now start make them question if they know exactly what it is. </p>
   <li>
    What happens if I ask you: what exactly is 1? 
   </li>
   <p>Pause. </p>
   <li>
    What exactly is a number? Do they have physical realization? Are they big, small or abstract. 
   </li>
  <p> I was going to conclude that we don't know what it is - nor is there a satisfactory answer. So I ended up saying
    that one of the most important thing in mathematics is the <i>structure </i> of the objects. </p>

</ul>
</p>
<p>
Surprising facts: without going into any set theory: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Students were very willing to accept the notion of sets as a "collection of objects". I think maybe I should completely skip the 
        section on set theory. Go directly with equivalence relation? But then I can't really work with the exercises. Hmmm 
    </li>
</ul>
</p>



<p>
    <i>30/08/23</i> Second day. Students were shocked when I got to the Russell paradox. 
    <ul>
        <li>
            Well, I thought the example with language was gonna be pretty interesting. That concatenation of English words is neither 
            associative nor commutative. Seems like student didn't enjoy it. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I think I should have begin with , "now forget about everything you knew about the world. Let's start from scratch, you don't have the naturals."
        </li>
    </ul>
    In conclusion as of first week. What worked well was <i>asking questions.</i> Instead of asking them to thinking outsdie of box, I should ask <i>what is a box</i>. 
</p>


<p>
    <i></i> Something I should try out. 
    <ul>
    <li>
        Ask the students to draw a picture of a set. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask the student to draw sit on table. 
    </li>
    </ul>
