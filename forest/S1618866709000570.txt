Abstract: Two hundred and fifty urban woody species are used in Central European parks and gardens. Based on reliable publications we attempt, for the first time, to extensively classify and assess them with regards to their usability after predicted climate changes. A new Climate-Species-Matrix has been developed for this purpose. In a two-dimensional assessment, four degrees of drought resistance and winter robustness are the decisive criteria. The woody species (divided into trees of more than 10m in potential height and trees/shrubs of up to 10m in height) were placed into 16 categories by decreasing tolerance, ranging from 1-1 (very suitable) to 4-4 (very limited usability). For many of these species, as well as many others that are not mentioned in this study, not all questions could be answered. Nonetheless, this categorization provides a sound basis for decisions in planning the use of woody species in cities. This planning process must also include additional criteria, dependent on individual requirements such as, soil parameters, shade resistance, aesthetics, etc. This paper is therefore meant to be a basis for discussion and supplementation for further research.
