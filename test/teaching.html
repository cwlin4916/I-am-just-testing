My role?
</section>

<p> [Last updated, October  10th, 2022] I  believe my role as a TA (Teaching assistant) is to:
<ul>
  <li>Give new perspective for the same content. Really, should I be talking about maths? <br>
    Maths is really about notions, but mathematicians are trained to interpret these notions in a certain way.  <br>
    What is this way of interpreting? It really depends on the field. 
    </li>
  <li> An advocate. </li>

</ul>
This page records some successes and failures, this is a collection of notes. Please do not read! 
</p>
<h3>In my TA (version 1) </h3>

<p> Would the following basic scheme work? 
<ol>
  <li> Outline what we will do. 5 mins. Ideas to point out.
    <ul>
      <li> It is importannt for us to discuss. </li>
      <li>Review the thought process. </li>
      <li>The meaning of each step. </li>
    <li>Often I will not give complete solutions. </li>
    <li>I encourage discussion. </li>
    </ul>
    [Dec, 2022, this type of style did not really work, there was simply not enough time and too many students to account of.]
  </li>

  <li> Review things from week n-1. 10 mins. An example. </li>
  <li> First 10 minutes. I will list and gauge the problems of students. </li>
  <li> Group work. 15 min. 5-6 people.  </li>
  <li>Work presentation. 10 min. Discussion. 10 min. </li>
  <li> A presentation of my own problem/ Homework. 15 mins. </li>
</ol>
Ok, so what to do with those people who find the class.  
Should I include a quiz? 
<ul>
  <li>Easy? </li>
  <li>Hard? </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>
  What would be a reasonable Calculus grading rubric? 
  These are computational, and often, there is a preferred method. 
  There are thus two aspects to such problems
  <ul><li>
    Knowing the method. 
  </li>
<li>Executing the method. This is also referred as computation below.   </li>
</ul>

I write a list below of the 2x2 possible grades out of 1. 
  <ul>
    <li> 1 :: correct method and computation </li>
    <li> 0.7 :: correct method but computational mistake, </li>
    <li> 0.5 :: correct answer but incorrect method/ correct computations and irrelevant method.  </li>
    <li> 0.2 :: incorrect method and calculation  - nice attempt!  </li>
  </ul>
  The reason I thus prefer a negative scheme is that most people are either in the first or second case. 
  There are of course other scenarios where we might want to deduct points. I list a few below
  
<ul>
  <li> -0.1 Repeated mistake.  </li>
  <li> -0.1 if using tricks which are unexplaiend. </li>
  <li> -0.3 to -0.6 for interpretng question incorrectly. </li>
</ul>
</p>
 <h3>Group work.
  </h3>
<section>
  Here is a SOP.
  <ol><li>Tasks.
    </li>
    <li>Space for student work. Should we have group roles? </li>
    <li> Consolodating the lesson. Drawing up on student work is often an effective.
    </li>
<li> Evaluation (?) </li>
  </ol>
</section>

</section>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Know how to check in: to see how things are going in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Communication.
      </li>
  </ul>
