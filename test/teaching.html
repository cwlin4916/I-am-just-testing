My role?
</section>

<p> I  believe my role as a TA is to:
<ul>
  <li>Give new perspective for the same content. Really, should I be talking about maths? <br>
    Maths is really about notions, but mathematicians are trained to interpret these notions in a certain way.  <br>
    What is this way of interpreting? It really depends on the field. 
    </li>
  <li> An advocate. </li>
</ul>
