    <h3>Terminology</h3>
    What I hate the most <a href="../philosophy.html#definitions">definitions</a>. 
    But this would facilitate discussion. 
    <h3>What is a forest?</h3>
    <p>
        It is interesting to see the history of
         <a href="../../forest/what_is_a_forest.pdf"> definition.</a> This has consequences. 
         For instance a focus on biodeveristy could stigmitize non-native species.

<h3>Role of torpical forest</h3>
<p>
    <ul><li>
        Regulate water
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduce greenhouse gases.
    </li>
    <li>...</li>
</ul>

Current situation:
<ul>
    <li>
        Almost 1/2 of world's tropical have been lost. 
    </li>
    <li>
        1/4 of global land area is subject to soil erosion,  wedtalnd drainage.
    </li>
    <li>....</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p></p>
Driving forces: Note: it is important to understand the dynamics at play here.

    <li>
        Illegal logging.
    </li>
    <li>
        Large-scale plantations.  
    </li>
    <li>...  </li>
</p>

<p>
    Goals: 
    <li>
        Converse biodiversity. 
    </li>

<h4>Forest-climate relation</h4>
<p>
    Quick links: <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/numbers-value-tropical-forests-climate-change-equation">the value of Tropical</a>. 
</p>
<p>
   Forest->climate:
<ul>
    <li>Albedo, the propotion of life reflected. This vary lin attitude.
        Hennce conclusions one can make:
        <ul>
            <li>Boreal forest, can have negative efffective in cooling climate, <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/205166#:~:text=Tropical%20forests%20cool%20the%20land,in%20comparison%20to%20open%20spaces." >Tropical has net cooling.</a> </li>
        </ul>  </li>
    <li>Evoporative cooling, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evapotranspiration#:~:text=Vegetation%20type%20impacts%20levels%20of,into%20the%20plant%20and%20leaves.">ET</a>. </li>
    <li>
        VOCs and Methane emmissions.
    </li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
Climate -> forest. 
<ul>
    <li>Carbon dioxide. Higher concetrate can lead to photosynthetic rate - but to what extent? -  and increased trea growth.
    Research suggests these can be cancelled out. 
    <ul>
        <li>Higher nighttime temperature increase plant respiration. </li>
        <li>Increase drought eads to increase mortality. </li>
    </ul>
 </li>
    <li>Temperature.</li>
    <li>Precipitation,  severe droughts. </li>
    <li>Organisms. 
        <ul>
            <li> acclimate, adapt, migrate, or extinct?
            </li>
        </ul>

    </li>
</ul>

<p>Forest experiences various disturbances. 
    <ul>
        <li>Disturbances can cause new niches. </li>
        <li>The equilibrium concept. </li>
        <li> Human disturbances. Lannd use histories.  </li>
    </ul>
    Forest changes. 
    <ul>
        <li>
           How to tell if change of forest is natural? 
           We lack a lot of historical data.
