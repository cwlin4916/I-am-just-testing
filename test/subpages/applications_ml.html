    <h3>What is this page about?</h3>
    <p>This page is about applications of technology to adressing various questions relating nature, see
      <a href="../../Computer Science/role_AI_SDG_goals.pdf">it's role in SDG goals</a>. 
       I stole the following pictorial schema from the latter paper. 
      
      For AI I would mean briefly any technology that has the ability of: 
    <ul>
      <li>Perception - audio,visual,textual, i.e. face recognintion. </li>
      <li>Descision making - medical diagnosis.</li>
      <li>Prediction, 
       <ul>
<li>
  Hurricane <a href="../../Computer Science/novel_multimodal_forecast_Hurricane.pdf">forecast</a>,
  <li>PrevisIA, which predicts areas in Amazon rainforest prone to  deforestation.</li> 
</li>
       </ul>  </li>
      <li>Extraction and pattern recognintion</li>
    </ul> </p>

    <h4>Potential problems of applications</h4>
    There are many facets to consider in  the employment of  <a href="../../Computer Science/F/how_to_design_AI_for_social_good.pdf">AI for SDGs</a>.
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unequal distribution - do small farmers get the technology?</li>
        <li> Value misalignment.
          <ul>
            <li>How it is designed.</li>
            <li>How it is trained. Learning on regular news can induce societal bias.</li>
          </ul> 
          A related field of study is thus explainable AI.
           I should have a read at the references in <a href="https://acritch.com/from-math-grad-school-to-ai-alignment/">blog posts</a>.
        </li>
        <li>lack of interpretability</li>
      </ul>

   <h3>Ecology, Conservation</h3>


   <h4>What is Conservation?</h4>
  <p> Conservation includes maintaining
    <ul>
      <li>
diversity of species.
      </li>
      <li>
        genes
      </li>
      <li>
      ecosystems
      </li>
      <li>fucntions of the envorinment</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
I take this different to preservation. To start helping with habitat
we should understand how species interact  with ecosystems. The following are some areas, 
stolen from <a href="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Understanding-Conservation#:~:text=By%20conserving%20wildlife%2C%20we're,by%20environmental%20and%20human%20influences.">NWF</a>. 
<ul><li>
  Phenology. Birds migrate, and mammals hibernate. Species use changes in climate to determine when start breeding or flowering.
  Thus, can we make a converse statement?

</li>
<li>
  Food webs and bioaccumulation.
</li>
<li>Natural  distrubances.</li>
</ul>
</p>. 
  </p>

  I will give a particular page to that of forestry. 

  <p>Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Prevention of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn5Bf89Vhh4">logging</a>. </li>
      <li>
        Citizen science project, in particular Cornell's lab. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Application to Species distribution modelling <a href="../../Computer Science/high_Species_Distribution_Modelinng_CNN.pdf">using CNN</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Marine. </li>
      <li></li>
    </ul> 
  </p>

  <p>
  How about plants? One problem is to identify the species of plants.  What are some potential directions?
  <ul>
    <li>Species recognition, as in the competition PlantCLEF, but is it  <a href="https://www.noble.org/news/publications/ag-news-and-views/2001/may/plant-identification-is-it-worth-the-effort/#:~:text=The%20ability%20to%20know%2C%20or,trend%2C%20either%20upward%20or%20downward."> necessary</a>? </li>
    <li> </li>
  </ul>

<h4>Forest degradation</h4>

<p>This is <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-is-forest-degradation-and-why-is-it-bad-for-people-and-wildlife">different</a> to deforestation. 
  A good reference is Simula.
  The process can be 
<ul>
  <li>
    natural  such as fire, storm or disease. 
  </li>
  <li>
human induced, due to human logging. 
  </li>
</ul>
It is thus broadly defined as its lack of capacity to provided goods and services.
