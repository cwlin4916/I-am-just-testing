    <h3>What is this page about?</h3>
    <p>This page is about applications of technology to adressing various questions relating nature, see <a href="../../Computer Science/F/how_to_design_AI_for_social_good.pdf">AI for social good</a>, or <a href="../../Computer Science/role_AI_SDG_goals.pdf">it's role in SDG goals</a>. I stole the following pictorial schema from the latter paper. 
      
      For AI I would mean briefly any technology that has the ability to: 
    <ul>
      <li>Descision making</li>
    </ul> </p>

    <p>Potential problems of applications.
      <ul>
        <li> Value misalignment </li>
      </ul>
      I should have a read at <a href="https://acritch.com/from-math-grad-school-to-ai-alignment/">blog posts</a>.

   <h4>Ecology, Conservation</h4>


   <h5>What is Conservation?</h5>
  <p> Conservation includes maintaining
    <ul>
      <li>
diversity of species.
      </li>
      <li>
        genes
      </li>
      <li>
      ecosystems
      </li>
      <li>fucntions of the envorinment</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  This is <em>different</em> to preservation</p>. 
  </p>


  <p>Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Citizen science project, in particular Cornell's lab. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Application to Species distribution modelling <a href="../../Computer Science/high_Species_Distribution_Modelinng_CNN.pdf">using CNN</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Marine. </li>
      <li>Hurricane <a href="../../Computer Science/novel_multimodal_forecast_Hurricane.pdf">forecast</a>. </li>
    </ul> 
  </p>

  <p>
  How about plants? One problem is to identify the species of plants.  What are some potential directions?
  <ul>
    <li>Species recognition, as in the competition.</li>
    <li> </li>
  </ul>
